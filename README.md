Stock Trading meets neural networks. This is the continuation of my previous work.

The notebooks are a bit of a mess but contain lots of detail someone may find userful.
Otherwise, I will continue building on this repo to build a full-scale framework to train neural networks to predict stocks. Currently, I will be experimenting with transforming time-series data into images via GADF or GASF. Most recent experiments do show some promise but this requires extensive experimenting before going out there and going full diamondhands.

## Disclaimer

This is for fun and should not be used to actually trade (unless you're a degen like myself).

## Future Direction

Turning this into a full-blown framework to predict stock movement. This will contain models that run on technical indicators in different time windows and eventually using NLP for stock sentiment analysis.
